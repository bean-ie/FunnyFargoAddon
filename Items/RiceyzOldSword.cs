Its power is so great that it can destroy the universe with a single strike of its blade.\nThis sword is held only by those who are worthy of its power and only those who possess the strength and courage to wield it. A mortal wielding this sword would be obliterated by its sheer power. The sword has no equal and it cannot be destroyed. Its user has absolute control over everything and the sword can bring about the end of all things.\nWhen a player wields this sword, they are not bound by the laws of time and space.\nThe wielder of this sword becomes a God and can shape reality itself. They can control the weather and the very land beneath their feet. They are able to command all life forms to do their bidding. They become omniscient and all-knowing. Their will becomes the law.\nThe wielder of this sword has reached a level of power that is unthinkable and unfathomable. They have surpassed the limits of the mortal realm and have ascended to Godhood. They have become death, destroyer of worlds.\nThis legendary sword is beyond words and beyond description. Its power and wrath cannot be conveyed through mortal language or logic. Its edge is sharper than any blade known to exist and its ability to rend flesh is unmatched. The only thing scarier than the sword's capabilities is the mind of the owner. It is said that this sword is cursed with a demonic aura that will drive its wielder to insanity. It has been known to bring out the most vile and evil aspects of its possessors.\nAny creature that dares to oppose the wielder of this sword will be met with certain death and destruction.");
